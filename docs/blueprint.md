## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to reflect Sanztech's theme and signify premium quality.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) to provide contrast and make the gold elements stand out.
- Accent color: Lighter gold (#FFe580) to highlight key elements and CTAs without overwhelming the design.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable appearance. Especially suitable for headlines and cards, for a short amount of text. If longer text is anticipated in a section, use this for headlines and 'Inter' for body.
- Grid-based layout for the templates, ensuring a clean and structured presentation.
- Use minimalistic icons to represent template functionalities without overloading users with text.
- Subtle hover animations on template cards to provide feedback and improve user engagement.
